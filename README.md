<img src="https://github.com/mvfernando/shop_e-commerce_in_flutter_ui/blob/main/assets/images/coverShopUIFlutter.png" height="400">

I present this project, is this a Shop E-commerce UI responsive. I show you this a nice clean onboarding screen for your e-commerce app that can run both Andriod and iOS devices because it builds with flutter. I build a Sign in, Forgot Password screen with a custom error indicator, Sign Up and OTP screen,  home page, product page, last an order screen which has some cool stuff like swipe to remove.

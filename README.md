I present this project, i thi a Shop E-commerce UI responsive, i show you this a nice clean onboarding screen for your e-commerce app that can run both Andriod and iOS devices because it builds with flutter. I build a Sign in, Forgot Password screen with a custom error indicator, Sign Up and OTP screen,  home page, product page, last an order screen which has some cool stuff like swipe to remove.
